# spotify-automation

I had never played with AppleScript before, so I figured writing a script to control Spotify would be a good start. I dreamed of adding features that allowed you to skip a random amount of time into a song and then skip the song after some amount of time. Basically a way to "radio seek" a Spotify playlist. Maybe someday I'll add all that, but for now this just plays a semi-randomized amount of a song before switching to the next.
